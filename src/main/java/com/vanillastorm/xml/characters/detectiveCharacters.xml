        <legend>Detective Leń(Лень) is a detective from noir-world, which he saved once already. He is lazy most of the time, except that moments when ladies involved, or if he is in a good mood, which is usually noir-bad. He lost a lot of people, so he doesn't want to get attached to them.</legend>

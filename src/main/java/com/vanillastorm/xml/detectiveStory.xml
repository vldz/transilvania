            Detective Len had his usual nap in his noir cabinet.
            Suddenly a noir lady came into his noir bureau and screamed:
            - Detective Len?
            - Not available nowâ€¦
            - But i really, reeeally need your help, cos you are the only one...
            Detective continued to pretend that he was sleeping, but that never stopped that girl:
            - Someone is after me, and, he... no, IT ... it is not look like ... human. No one will believe me ...
            She started to noir cry:

            Fat woman took a cane, she was ready to kick his ass.
